Life in their village was peaceful and happy; however, the friends had grown restless of the everyday monotony and were looking for a new adventure. \\n\\nOne day, as chance would have it, the friends met one of the magicians that lived in the Magma Mountains. The old and wise magician was headed back to his home after a long journey and stopped for a long rest in the village. \\n\\nThe friends quickly befriended the old magician and told him about their need for a new adventure. The magician was instantly intrigued and decided to teach the friends a few tricks of his magical craft. \\n\\nThe next day, the morning sky shone in a flurry of orange and pink hues as the magician and his three pupils set out for the Magma Mountains. On their way to the magical peaks, they were joined by a talking parrot called Paki – a friend the old magician had made along his travels. \\n\\nThroughout their journey, Paki shared numerous stories of what was waiting for them at the Magma Mountains and taught the friends many valuable lessons about friendship, braveness and courage. \\n\\nFinally, after days and nights of traveling, the four of them reached the magical peaks. In awe, they saw that the mountains were surrounded by a beautiful wreath of white mist. Singing birds, twittering butterflies and lush greenery filled every corner of the magical land, and as they went further up the peaks, they saw that every tree and rock was made of solid gold! \\n\\nThe old Magician sat down on a golden boulder and watched as his pupils explored the mysterious land. A cooing dove flew down from one of the trees and handed them a magical medallion. The old Magician saw the look of wonder in the eyes of his young friends and told them it would take them to the heart of the Magma Mountains.\\n\\nThe old Magician bid them goodbye saying he had taught them all he could and that the rest of their adventure was up to them. Taking the magical medallion in hand, the three brave friends stepped forward into the heart of the mountain. \\n\\nUpon entering the magical peak, they stumbled upon a vast dragon\"\n",
